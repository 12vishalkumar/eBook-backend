## Installation
   - ###### Before you begin, ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system. You also need access to a SQL database, preferably PostgreSQL.
   - ###### <b>1. Clone the repository to your local machine:</b> git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ecommerce-api-nodejs.git
   - ##### <b>Come to inside your project</b>cd ecommerce-api-nodejs
   - ##### <b>2. Install the project dependencies:</b>npm install

## Configuration
   - ##### <b>1. Database Setup:</b> Create a new database in your SQL server. Update the database connection settings in config/database.js or .env file with your database details.

<h2><b>Note:</b></h2><p>I Again sait please use the correct APIs otherwise you get errors and you do not able to test APIs if you use wrong APIs.</p>
<p>If you not able to use APIs, Please go though the code and use the base on the given code URL then must be able to test APIs.</p>
